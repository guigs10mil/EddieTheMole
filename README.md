## The Game

In this game you control a small agile mole called Eddie that drills out of most of his problems. Drilling underground allows Eddie to avoid enemies and attack them when he emerges. There are currently two levels that explore how Eddie's movement mechanics work. And the coins that are scattered throughout the levels unfortunately still do nothing...

## About The Project
The main focus of this project was to utilize the design philosophy that one action can solve multiple problems. This means that an action such as 'drilling' can be used in different contexts to do different things. For example, while in the air drilling can be used to attack enemies and fall faster, but when grounded the character avoids incoming attacks by drilling underground. This concept allows the game to have a diverse set of actions that can be performed with just a few input buttons.
